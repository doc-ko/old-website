I recently started using https://neovim.io[Neovim], simply out of interest.
Ever since I started working as a technical writer, taking my hands off the keyboards to use my mouse has become a very tedious action, and a dreaded one when it comes to dealing with certain applications.

For example, clicking on something on Microsoft Word or Madcap Flare would inevitably mean running a process that could end up taking several seconds (or even minutes!) to run.
This has conditioned me into thinking that taking my hands off my keyboard equals an upcoming dip in productivity, as I wait for a process to finish.

It was with this mindset that I found the program `vim` once again.
I had heard about vim beforehand, but as with most people, the learning curve and barrier of entry to vim put me off for a while.
