= The Three Parts of Documentation

== Introduction

A document can be broken down into three parts:

. *Technical Data*: data that comes from the program/code base, e.g. fields that appear in a screen, the alphanumeric format of a field, screen layout.

. *Explanation*: the writing that explains the technical data.
This is the value of documentation, in that it bridges the gap between the technical data and the reader.

. *Formatting*: what the document looks like for the reader.
This includes things like font, document format, page layout, branding, etc.

Technical Data and Explanation are more closely linked to each other than formatting.
Hence, we can group them into a sub-structure called *Content*.
This graph demonstrates their overall relationship:

== Each part has different stakeholders

We bring this into attention because, in terms of _stakeholders_, these three parts have little overlap:

Technical Data::
* Dev team (back-end)
* QA?

Explanation::
* Technical writer
* Dev team (back-end): _only at a high-level_
* Project manager

Formatting::
* Customer support
* Product team
* Front-end devs (?)

=== Too many cooks in the Word file

In a Word document, changes from all three parts must be made from that Word document.
These changes are often very tightly coupled with one another;
any change to one part tends to break a different part.

For example,

* Copy-pasting the details of a new feature (*technical data*) from one Word file also copy-pastes *formatting* like font family, size, which requires extra time to fix.

* A branding decision (*formatting*) like changing the name of a product necessitates updates to the entire document (*technical data/explanation*).
This is hardly straightforward, as you may wish to leave the old name in certain contexts for legacy purposes.

The result is that Word documents become a confusing mess of changes after enough time.

== Decoupling the three parts

To improve the documentation writing lifecycle, we must decouple the three parts.
The goal is that, should one part need an update, the impact on the other two parts are minimal.
The following diagram provides an overview of how this can be achieved, plus where each stakeholder can provide their input on the document.
